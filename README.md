# Project Title: Youth-Basketball-Program-Excel Project 




## Project Overview
The analysis shows that August is the peak revenue month, while December and November are the lowest-performing months. The 11–15 age group drives the highest revenue contribution, and programs such as Summer Camp, AAU Teams, and General/Non-Specific training attract the most customers. Overall, the program demonstrates strong financial performance, high customer engagement, and clear seasonal trends.

  **This report examines the performance of the Youth Basketball Program, with the aim of understanding revenue patterns, customer demographics, program demand, and payment behavior.**

  
**Key metrics include:**

*Total Revenue: $5.0M

*Total Customers: 11,275

*Programs Offered: 27	

*Payment Completion: 93% paid; $358K outstanding

*Top Revenue Cities: Greenwich, Stamford, Riverside, Darien






## Reports

- **Methodology**: 

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, primarily leveraging Pivot Tables to summarize and organize data. Pivot Charts, slicers, and conditional formatting were used to visualize key trends and reveal patterns.
- **Data Analysis**:
  
**1. Seasonal Revenue Pattern**
   
  * Peak Month: August, driven by high enrollment in Summer Camps and competitive programs.

  * Lowest Months: December, followed by November, due to holiday periods and off-season inactivity.

**2. Customer Demographics**
   
  * The 11–15 age group is the core revenue driver, contributing $3.2M.

  * Other age groups contribute modestly, with 20+ years generating the least revenue.

**3. Top-Performing Programs**
 
  * Summer Camp, AAU Teams, and General/Non-Specific programs attract the highest customer counts.

  * Smaller programs include Elite MS Camps and Girls Summer Camps.

**4. Geographic Revenue Concentration**
   
  * Top revenue cities include Greenwich ($912K), Stamford ($853K), Riverside, and Darien.
  * These areas represent high-income, high-participation communities.

**5. High-Value Families**
   
  * The Cartiera family is both the highest-paying and the largest participating household (132 customers).
  * Several other families contribute strong recurring revenue.

## Conclusion  
These results suggest that the program has a solid financial base, strong demand among early-to-mid teens, and high participation in summer-driven activities. 
## Recommendations
Based on the findings, it is recommended to expand high-demand programs, introduce off-season training to reduce revenue dips, focus marketing on top-paying cities, and develop loyalty initiatives for high-value families.
